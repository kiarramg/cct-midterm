## sample info:
### Include: Model Structure: We used the core CCT formulation where each answer depends on a latent true answer and individual competence.

### Priors: D ~ Beta(2, 2) is mildly informative and restricts to [0,1] with mass around 0.5–1.

### Z ~ Bernoulli(0.5) is uninformative.

### Results: Show top and bottom informants by competence, most agreed-upon questions, etc.

### Convergence: Note R-hat ≈ 1.0 and high ESS = good.

### Majority vote vs. CCT: Explain any differences (e.g., CCT down-weights low-competence informants).
